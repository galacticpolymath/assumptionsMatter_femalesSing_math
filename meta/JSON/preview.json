It explains that during peer review, a scientist requested that the scatter plot in the Polymath Puzzle (based on an actual figure in the scientific paper) should have been a histogram. Next, the students will be asked to use the raw study data to create a histogram and decide which is actually a better way to visualize the study findings.",
