                "StepDetails": "By spending some time introducing students to ciphers, we are laying the groundwork for cipher-based puzzle hooks for each part of this lesson. The Polymath Puzzle in Part 1 draws students into decoding the labels on a graph in order to engage them in trying to understand the next level of meaning in the graph, creating a rich data literacy learning experience. In the first step, students learn that ciphers are used to make a secret message. We use a simple cipher called an alphabetic shift, where each letter of each word in a message has been shifted a certain number of places (e.g. +1 would mean A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on).\nThis section works on assimilating new vocabulary, as well as encouraging students to have a growth mindset. They need to quickly orient themselves to the \"system\" of ciphers and how they work. Parts 2 and 3 of the lesson will build on this engagement hook.",
                "Vocab": "- **algorithm :** a set of steps, like a mathematical recipe\n- **alphabetic shift:** type of cipher where each letter has been shifted a certain number of places (dictated by the algorithm)\n- **cipher:** a secret message that uses an algorithm to make a message seem like nonsense\n- **decipher:** 1) to convert a secret message into readable text; 2) to succeed in understanding something \n- **encipher:** convert readable text (plaintext) into a secret message\n- **plaintext:** readable text (not a cipher)",
                "TeachingTips": "Ask students to read slides and predict what the next slide will be (e.g. the next letter in the alphabetic shift). Model a growth mindset, and that it's ok to not completely understand at first."

This is self-fulfilling, as females often look similar to males, sing much less in total & only sing early in the breeding season.\n- This is a form of confirmation bias (though we don’t introduce that term), where we may latch onto evidence that confirms our preexisting assumptions. (And we should be wary of that).\n- The scatter plot was a better visualization for this data because it shows the timing of song and when scientists need to focus study of female song to address this gap in our knowledge.\n"
