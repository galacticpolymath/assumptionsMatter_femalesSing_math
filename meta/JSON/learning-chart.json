    "Description": "This Galactic Polymath Learning Chart illustrates the areas of knowledge covered. This lesson targets Math, but it helps teach national learning standards in 4 subjects: \n- [Common Core Math](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/); [Common Core ELA](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/); [Next Generation Science (NGSS)](https://www.nextgenscience.org/); and [College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Social Studies Standards](https://www.socialstudies.org/standards/c3).\nIn total, there are 25 standards across US grade band(s): 5-6, 7-8, 9-12.",
    "Footnote": "**Notes on Standards**\n\n*Standards are broken down into ***Target*** and ***Connected*** categories. Target standards are directly reinforced or taught; connected standards are not fully addressed in the lesson, but connected enough to provide a foundation for teachers to build upon.",
